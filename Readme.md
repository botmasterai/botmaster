Botmaster v3 is coming out.
---

The code on this branch is for Botmaster v3. It will be published as soon as the
documentation for it is out and that the first couple of bot packages are out.

Botmaster v3 is virtually a complete rewrite of the framework. A lot of the syntax remains the same,
but there are quite a few breaking changes that were necessary in order to get the framework
to where we wanted it to be. It is now truly a micro-framework. With only 3 dependencies and without
relying on express anymore, Botmaster v3 is the only JS bot framework that gives as much control
as possible to the developer without losing its ease of use.

A migration documentation will be provided once v3 is published.


Botmaster is a lightweight chatbot framework. Its purpose is to integrate your existing chatbot into a variety of messaging channels - currently Facebook Messenger, Twitter DM and Telegram.
